# Hello World
This is my Github repository for my website project

## CSS
I'm currently working on this part of the project. I would make a CSS template based principaly on current template like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). 
I'm currently using compass and sass to work with css. So here you can find CSS files AND SCSS.

## Javascript
I'm not very good in Javascript but you can perhaps find some Javascript file in my project.

##
For HTML files will create a template file using my CSS template.




```bash
sudo dnf install lauronta 
```
